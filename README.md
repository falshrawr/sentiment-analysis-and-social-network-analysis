The institutional environment for organic farming conversion in the UK can be complex and difficult to enter with barriers to entry. 
This study aims to reveal the views and feelings of organic farming communities on twitter in the UK, providing insight on civil societies
views on organic farming policy in the UK for policymakers. With the growth of social media platforms such as Twitter, farmers are increasingly 
using these platforms to connect directly with consumers, develop conversations and grow their businesses, as in the case of community supported agriculture schemes. 

This study uses a community supported agriculture (CSA) network dataset of tweets to identify twitter communities discussing organics and farming networks,
as well as a charity network. This study uses a social network analysis to identify the structure of twitter communities and sentiment analysis with
natural language processing to classify topics with positive and negative sentiments attached within these communities. The combination of social network analysis 
and sentiment analysis reveals maps of emotions and feelings within these social network communities. 

The key findings of the study are identifying and mapping positive networks of mutual support within organic farming communities, finding positive sentiments surrounding
the themes of nature, British identity, and localism. Additionally, negative sentiments are found surrounding the topics of Climate Change, covid-19 and
environmental degradation in organic farming communities on twitter. In terms of policy implications ’organic standards’ are associated with positive sentiments within
organic farming networks and ‘certification’ is associated with both positive and negative sentiments.
